# Page under construction ...
Repo for my personal github.io page based on a template for academic pages ([Academicpages template](https://academicpages.github.io/)).

This template was forked (then detached) by me from [Academicpages template](https://academicpages.github.io/) after it was forked and detached by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License.
