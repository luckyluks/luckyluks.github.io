## Bachelor Thesis in Mechatronics

An app orientation, with apps for personalised expansion of the functionality of smartphones, is a successful concept in the consumer sector. In principle, this concept can also be transferred to machine tools, whereby the term value-added service is often used here. In the iWindow research project, such value-added services are used and, installed subsequently, extend the augmented reality machine window with additional functionalities. The container technology Docker is used, which encapsulates the value-added services with all dependencies in so-called images, similar to an app of a smartphone. Up to now, however, installation has only been possible by hand.  

Therefore the aim of this thesis was to develop a distribution concept for the value-added services of iWindow. For this purpose, available App Store solutions from the mobile and industrial sector were first examined for use in the research project. Since no solution met the requirements, own concepts for the distribution were developed, use cases were defined and a value-added service store was designed as a distribution platform for the value-added services. A prototype adapted to the iWindow value-added services was realised and successfully validated during the work.

**Technologies used:** Docker (compose and repository), ASP.Net-Core (website and REST API)  
**Project:** corresponding research project: [iWindow](https://www.iwindow.info/)
