title: "Usable surface detection on top-view camera data
using automatic ground truth generation for binary semantic segmentation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-01-17-Usable-surface-detection-on-top-view-camera-data
excerpt: 'Short abstract - This project aims to solve the problem to detect drivable
areas of a factory floor, using a workflow consisting
of background subtraction to generate a ground truth, that is
then used to train a neural network. The output could potentially
be used as a mapping for which a scheduler or robot control
system could work upon to avoid collisions and problems with
dynamic obstacles.'
