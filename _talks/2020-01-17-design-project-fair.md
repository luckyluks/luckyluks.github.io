Group presentation/demonstration of the final result in the course "<i>Design Project in MPSYS - Systems, Control and Mechatronics </i>" at a mini fair after 3 months of work.  

We presented our live demo of a drivable surface detection with our trained model on a raw camera stream. Additionally we had a basic poster for explanation of the approach and a video showing potential drawbacks of our final version, where we recorded critical situations in the CASE lab environment [CASE lab homepage](https://www.caselabbet.se/).
